# Ducks Unlimited

This is a Minecraft mod, initially based on the Fabric developer guide hosted here:

<https://docs.fabricmc.net/develop/>

This mod was developed using VS Code and includes a "dev container" that can be used to develop without a Java-intensive IDE or local system installation. From VS Code's command palette (CTRL+SHIFT+P on Windows), look for the "Dev Container: Rebuild and Reopen in Container" option (or similar). Once the container spins up, you should have access to a Java developer environment configured to build the command via gradle:

```sh
./gradlew build
```
